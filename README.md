# Boston Airbnb Dataset

## How much should you price your Boston Airbnb?

In this repository, we take a look at Airbnb data for Boston to give new hosts an idea of the sort of prices they should be charging.

The dataset came through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ryanfox212/how-much-should-you-price-your-boston-airbnb) but can be accessed directly from [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

The 'UnderstandingPricing' notebook can also be viewed on [Kaggle as a kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/ryanfox212/how-much-should-you-price-your-boston-airbnb).
